# Mobile Applications Project Assignment with Flutter
A simple `mobile game` you can make with basic flutter knowledge
```
We are looking for our randomly assigned number between 1 and 25 that appears on the screen
in our 5x5 array of boxes. We have the right to refresh the number, we have 1 minute and we
get 1 point for each number we find. If our score is between 0 and 3 we get 0 stars, between
3 and 7 we get 1 star, between 7 and 12 we get 2 stars and more than 12 we get 3 stars.

> [!WARNING]
> Run "flutter clean" from the terminal to run the project, then restore what you cleaned from the "pubsec.yaml" file. Otherwise you will not be able to run the project
